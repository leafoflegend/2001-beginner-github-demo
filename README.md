## Git, how does it work?

~~Linus Torvalds built git, and because of that, it must work.~~

After meeting him, and him ignoring me, I have decided Linus may have made some mistakes in his life, including in git. I think we should review if git is a good idea or not.

Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
